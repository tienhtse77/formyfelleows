Mind your small steps.

This one just came naturally to me on the first half day, after four hours of climbing. I was very tired with my 8 kg backpack, mostly water and clothes for three days of trekking. The thing was, at that point, I didn’t know when I would reach the resting place. I didn’t know how far and how high I had to climb further. The only thing I could do was lift my leg to the next stone and make sure it was firm enough so that I could pull my whole body up. Since the forest was dense and dark, the weather was foggy, I couldn’t look far ahead either, and if I had tried to do so, I would not be able to sit here writing this.

And there was a question suddenly popping up in my mind, if I didn't know how far/high I've climb, what are the things keep me climbing TIREDLESSLY? And the answer is I didn't know anything but I did know that eventually I can reach the top of the mountain IN A DAY OR TWO (THE RESULT IS GUARANTEED/LOW RISK) as long as I keep lifting my legs and EVERY STEP I TAKE I KNOW FOR SURE (THE RESULT IS GUARANTEED/LOW RISK) THAT IT WILL BRING ME CLOSER TO THE GOAL. 

And while writing this down, I can see how what kind of person I am, as long as the result is guaranteed, I would kill myself until I made it, and this is the easiest thing that life offers for me. But how can the result be guaranteed? People will tell me that if I climb constantly in 3 days I will complete the mountain trip. It's okay if eventually I couldn't finish it, it's only 1/1000 of my time, I could try again. But what if in another situation, where I spend years for doing thing and then it won't work out, what I have left then.

So should I always choose the guaranteed result and aim for it? Or should I just don't care the result and just do it? Or maybe at the begining I shouldn't expect the result at all. So I think the goal is there for me to be able to focus on that goal, so that I can defy the actions that I want to take, and it shouldn't do anything more than that, the action itself should be the important thing. I choose the result in my control. If I learn English, the result I want is today I will spend 1 hour to learn English and that's it. I'm not gonna force myself in that hour I have to remember all the words that I learn, I could remember it today, or tomorrow or several years later. I don't have any solution for this to be honest, sometimes the final result is too amused that I couldn't get my mind off thinking about it. Or maybe the final result sometimes is too vague, I'll never be there so I don't know what it looks like, have an imagination of that in my head will create the expectation but that's ridiculous, I'll say it again, I've not been there yet so it's stupid to say at that point I will have to be this or to be that. And maybe the only thing I could grab on to move on is I know that I'm doing the good things and that is the thing I want to do, trust the process and let the process supprise me. And probably that is it, mind your own smallest step, keep reevaluate that on each period of time depend on what kind of action I'm doing. 


And that, in a way, shares some similarity with what I’ve experienced when setting goals in my life.

I wanted to be fluent in English, German, and Japanese, but I was too focused on the top of these mountains, where I could speak those languages fluently, and ignored the importance of small steps, so I failed. Let's say there were a magic candy, I eat one and immediately become fluent in English, would I do so? My answer is no, why? The beauty of a journey is the experience, and that's what make me grow. I will never learn how to be patient with the result? I will never be able to learn to trust the process first, I'll never learn to give away first without expecting things in return. I will never know what kinds of rock should/shoudn't I step in, I will never know there were a lot of vắt in the wet tropical forest and it will make you bleeding unstopbalely until you have the weed that make cigarete stuck in, I'll never know that there are amazing people out there also working very hard to meet themself. And there will never be this blog. And then eventually, I relise that I'm not proud of what I was born with, I'm proud of what I become during these journeys.

"Making progress" isn't always visible.
"Making progress" to me means I keep doing things and AFTER EACH TIME I CAN SEE THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK.
After day one and day two, I was supprised that how good I am at climbing. The more I kept moving my legs, the better I am, I can feel I learn something in every step, if I put my feet on the wrong direction, I can learn it immediately and that lesson can be applied right away for the next leg moving and this loop happens repeatedly. And it's till the point that I can be confident enough to move without using hands to grab or keep the balance. And that gives me the feeling of I'm "making progress" and it was so satisfied. But thinking of it now, this is the first time I've done mountain trekking, so there were so much to learn and it was all about exciting. And if I take this to other things, it was always exciting when I first started. And then when things got harder, these moments will of course happen less frequently and maybe take months or years to have you that another Aha moment. Therefore, the flood of Aha moments at the begining could be the đòn bẩy that pushes me forward but it also makes me craving more that moments to continue. Knowing that helps me expect less and give more trust and commitment into the process. 
And it’s not necessarily that this would guarantee my failure; sometimes it just makes the whole journey terrible. But one thing I’m thinking of right now — climbing always gives me feedback immediately so that I know I’m making progress with every step, i. But it’s not always the case with other goals.

Learning one new word won’t make my English sound better immediately, so it won’t give me the feeling that I’m making progress. And that’s just how it is — progress isn’t always visible, or maybe it’s completely wrong the way I understand “making progress.” So the question is: Is it necessary that making progress means being better? What if making progress just means I keep doing things?

Is there something not really correct here? Should I act first without considering whether it is an improvement step or not, and then reevaluate the method afterward? For now, I don’t have the answer for this. I’ll try, and my future self will give an update on it.

The answer is quite obvious to me when I reread the first passage: I had better try and assess the process constantly, but the period of each assessment should be considered deliberately.

For example, with running I can feel my strength and resilience improve week by week, maybe even day by day, and the feedback usually comes after every session in some form like: “How many minutes do I need to finish 10 km? Do my legs hurt if I try to move my feet a bit to the left?” — and that is the form of feedback for running.

With language learning, the time should be much more extended. Learning ten words today won’t show any change in your language journey, but doing it for three months will probably make a difference. And how should I assess my language? There’s no watch that can calculate how well or badly my English has improved. But I will be more confident for sure, and probably my writing will also be better. I’ll give another update in three months.

Why doesn't I like travelling?

Why does I only care the chop of the mountain?

Making small change

I'm now reading a book to get my answers
Still reading it TT
Reading it now
Still reading it :D
Looks like a reading tracker now! I'll finish this in the weekend!
Reading it now!
